[Stats]
//this section is the most important from a statistical point of view.  these are the actual input values from a .csv file which will go on to affect the rest of the website.  
//i'm not sure how exactly this will work (i imagine you do), but i can definitely provide the .csv files once we figure out how to format them.  it will probably be a matter of simply reformatting the existing files (which are mostly done).

//for example:

[Score-sheets]
//here would be a drop-down box which would show/hide the scanned score-sheets.  we will need high-quality scans of high-quality score-sheets, so this part will need to have a lot of care and time taken to ensure that.
